QUESTION:-
Union of two arrays can be defined as the common and distinct elements in the two arrays.
Given two sorted arrays of size n and m respectively, find their union.

Example 1:
Input:
n = 5, arr1[] = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}
m = 3, arr2 [] = {1, 2, 3}
Output: 1 2 3 4 5
Explanation: Distinct elements including
both the arrays are: 1 2 3 4 5.

Example 2:
Input:
n = 5, arr1[] = {2, 2, 3, 4, 5}
m = 5, arr2[] = {1, 1, 2, 3, 4}
Output: 1 2 3 4 5
Explanation: Distinct elements including
both the arrays are: 1 2 3 4 5.

APPROACH:-
-> Take two pointer i and j where i is for arr1 and j is for arr2 and traverse
-> While travsersing 3 cases arises
    -> arr1[ i ] == arr2[ j ]
        Here we found a common element, so insert only one element in the union.
        Letâ€™s insert arr[i] in union and whenever we insert element we increment pointer while pointer is not equal to the inserted element
    -> arr1[i]<arr2[j]
        Here insert arr[i]
    -> arr1[i]>arr2[j]
        Here insert arr2[j]
-> Now check if elements of any array is left to traverse then traverse that array

// CODE:-
#include<iostream>
using namespace std;

int main(){
    int arr1[]={1,2,5,8,6};
    int arr2[]={8,5,2,4,6};
    int n1=sizeof(arr1)/sizeof(arr1[0]);
    int n2=sizeof(arr2)/sizeof(arr2[0]);
    int i=0,j=0;
    while(i<n1 && j<n2){
        if(arr1[i]<arr2[j]){
            cout<<arr1[i]<<" ";
            i++;
        }
        else if(arr1[i]>arr2[j]){
            cout<<arr2[j]<<" ";
            j++;
        }
        else{
            cout<<arr1[i]<<" ";
            i++;
            j++;
        }
    }
    while(i<n1){
        cout<<arr1[i]<<" ";
        i++;
    }
    while(j<n2){
        cout<<arr2[j]<<" ";
        j++;
    }
}
// TIME COMPLEXITY = O(N+M)
// SPACE COMPLEXITY = O(0)
