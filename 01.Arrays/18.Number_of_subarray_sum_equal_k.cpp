QUESTION:
Given an array of integers nums and an integer k, return the total number of subarrays whose sum equals to k.

Example:
Input: nums = [1,1,1], k = 2
Output: 2

APPROACH:
To find the total number of subarrays with sum equal to k, we can use the technique of prefix sum along with a hashmap.
1. Initialize a variable `count` to keep track of the count of subarrays with sum equal to k.
2. Initialize a variable `prefixSum` to keep track of the prefix sum while iterating through the array.
3. Initialize a hashmap `sumCount` to store the frequency of prefix sums encountered so far.
4. Set the initial prefix sum to 0 and set its count to 1 in the `sumCount` hashmap.
5. Iterate through the array and update the prefix sum by adding each element.
6. Check if the current prefix sum minus k exists in the `sumCount` hashmap. If it does, add the count of that prefix sum to the `count` variable.
7. Increment the count of the current prefix sum in the `sumCount` hashmap.
8. Finally, return the `count` variable as the total number of subarrays with sum equal to k.

CODE:

#include<iostream>
using namespace std;
 int main(){
    int arr[] = {1, 1, 1};
    int n = sizeof(arr)/sizeof(arr[0]);
    int k = 2;
    int count = 0;
    for(int i = 0; i < n; i++){
        int sum = 0;
        for(int j = i; j < n; j++){
            sum += arr[j];
            if(sum == k){
                count++;
            }
        }
    }
    cout << "Number of subarrays with sum equal to " << k << " is: " << count << endl;
    return 0;
}
/*
TIME COMPLEXITY: O(n), where n is the size of the input array nums.
SPACE COMPLEXITY: O(n), as we are using a hashmap to store the prefix sums and their corresponding counts.
